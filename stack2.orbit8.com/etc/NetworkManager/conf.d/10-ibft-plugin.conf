# This file enables the standalone 'iBFT' settings plugin to read
# iBFT information with iscsiadm and create connections from that
# data.
#
# Do not edit this file; it will be overwritten on upgrades. If you
# want to override the values here, or set additional values, you can
# do so by adding another file (eg, "99-local.conf") to this directory
# and setting keys there.
